# Salary-Calculator
Making a minimal, yet useful calculator for users to figure out their salary based off of hourly wages, or vice-versa


This is a basic webapp to help myself learn font-end development while creating a tool that I find myself searching for quite a bit. In my searches I cannot seem to find an unbloated salary calculator. I hope that, as I learn, I can implement more features, but retain the minimalist aesthetic.
